# Home Assistant Add-on: Valetudo Proxy

## How to use

This addon allows you to access your Valetudo web interface from inside Home Assistant.

In the configuration set `Address` to the hostname or ip address of your robot.
You can find the hostname in the web interface under **Connectivity->Network Advertisement->Zeroconf Hostname**.

If you have Basic Auth enabled on your robot you also need to set your username and password to the values they are set to on the robot.
